# dkimscan
A scanner for DKIM selectors.

This is some code I wrote in early 2012 that I realized I'd never gotten around
to releasing. An extensive list of common selectors and selector patterns is
built in. Please be aware that this sends a very high volume of queries and may
take several minutes to run a full scan.
